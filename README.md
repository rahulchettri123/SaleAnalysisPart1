This project involves performing data analysis on 12 months of sales data using pandas library in Python. The data is first merged into a single file and cleaned up to remove any inconsistencies or missing values. Necessary columns are added to the dataset to make analysis easier.

The project aims to answer several questions related to the sales data such as identifying the best month for sales and the corresponding amount earned in that month. It also aims to identify the city with the highest number of sales and the optimal time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying the product.

The project also involves analyzing which products are most often sold together and which product sold the most overall. The reasons behind why the most sold product was so successful are also explored.

By performing this data analysis, businesses can gain insights into their sales performance and make informed decisions on areas such as marketing strategy, product offerings, and sales optimization.
